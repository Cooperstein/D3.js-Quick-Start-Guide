# Force Directed Graphs

## Describe a Force Directed Graph

- A force directed graph is a graph that is affected by various forces (e.g. gravity, repulsion, etc)
- It can be extremely useful when setting up graphs of relationships

## Describe how a to set up a graph of relationships

### Display

- We're going to have a list of nodes representing people and display them as circles
- We're going to have a list of links representing connections between people and display them as lines

### Physics

- We're going to have a gravitational force at the center of the `svg` that draws all nodes towards it
- We're going to have forces on each node so that they repel each other
- We're going to have link forces that connect each of the nodes so that they don't repel each other too much

## Set up the HTML

Pretty standard, but we'll need two `<g>` elements:

- One to contain the nodes (people - circles)
- One to contain the links (relationships - lines)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <svg>
            <g id="nodes"></g>
            <g id="links"></g>
        </svg>
        <script src="app.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
